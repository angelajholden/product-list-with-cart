This is a simple, clean product cart built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

Itâ€™s based on a project called **Product List with Cart** â€” from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-list-with-cart-5MmqLVAp_d). The goal of this project is to turn a static design into accessible, modern code â€” and make it easy for anyone to customize or learn from. Itâ€™s mobile responsive and includes an interactive product cart.

_This project is part of a free, open-source series focused on helping newer developers practice HTML/CSS with real-world examples._
